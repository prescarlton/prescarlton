### Hey, I'm Preston.
#### I'm a software developer from Charleston, SC

I work on all kinds of things, from pipeline development in Python, 
to AR Web Experiences, to intuitive React-based kiosks.


Right now, I'm working on a React Todo list app called [Tido](https://github.com/prescarlton/tido). 

When I'm not hunched over my laptop coding, I spend most of my time in the woods camping, hiking, or mountain biking.
