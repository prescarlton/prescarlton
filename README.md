### Hey, I'm Preston.
#### I'm a software developer from Charleston, SC

I work on all kinds of things from pipeline development in Python, to APIs built in Express, to websites built in React.


Right now, I'm working on a project management tool built in React/Express/Prisma. As soon as I have a demo worth sharing, I'll be sure to share it here.

When I'm not hunched over my laptop coding, I spend most of my time in the woods camping, backpacking or 4-wheeling in my Jeep.
