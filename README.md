### Hey, I'm Preston.
#### I'm a software developer from Charleston, SC

I work on all kinds of things, from pipeline development in Python, 
to AR Web Experiences, to intuitive React-based kiosks.


Right now, I'm working on a React-based site to track my ever-expanding list of movies I want to watch. When I have something worth sharing, I'll be sure to update this.

When I'm not hunched over my laptop coding, I spend most of my time in the woods camping, hiking, or mountain biking.
