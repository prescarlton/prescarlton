### Hey, I'm Preston.
#### I'm a software developer from Charleston, SC

I work on all kinds of things from pipeline development in Python, to webapps built in React, to R&D on Raspberry Pis.


Right now, I'm working on an easier way to manage your existing AWS infrastructure. It's not quite ready to share yet, but I'm working hard to get somethign worth sharing.

When I'm not hunched over my laptop coding, I spend most of my time in the woods camping, backpacking or 4-wheeling in my Jeep.
